	"answers": {
		"preparation": "Wikimedia will start listing projects only by mid-February and mid-August on the corresponding subpages of [Google Summer of Code](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) and [Outreachy](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreachy) on MediaWiki.org. If you would like to start preparing before the application period opens, here are a few ideas for you to explore:\n* Learn about the application process steps and recipe of a successful internship for a Google Summer of Code or Outreachy project.\n* Involve yourself in an existing Wikimedia project by fixing a few software bugs listed on the [Good first bugs](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Good_first_bugs) page.\n* Make small contributions to [New Developers](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers) projects.",
		"startworking": "You could start with expressing your interest in working on the project by commenting on the [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org) task associated with it. You could then set up up the development environment and choose a microtask to work on. Microtasks would be linked from each project's task description on Phabricator. Mentors will guide you in the process and help you make a contribution to the project.",
		"problem": "Depends very much on the nature of the problem. If you're running into a project-specific technical problem, reach out to the project mentors directly in the communication channel they're most active or on their preferred method of contact. You will find this information highlighted in the project descriptions on the GSoC and Outreachy page on MediaWiki.org. For a general technical problem around Wikimedia projects (e.g., setting up the MediaWiki development environment or contributing to MediaWiki extensions), ask for help in the  [Wikimedia Developer Support](https://discourse-mediawiki.wmflabs.org/)  channel. For any program related questions, reach out to program administrators in the  [Zulip](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreach_programs/Zulip) chat.\nPlease first read  [How to become a MediaWiki hacker#Feedback, questions and support](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker#Feedback,_questions_and_support)  how to (not) ask questions.",
		"whichproject": "In all our projects, we list the level of expertise and skills required. Although you can choose to share your skillset with organization administrators, all they might be able to do is point you to the list of projects you might have seen already on MediaWiki.org. It might be ideal if you assess for yourself which project best suits you based on the skills required, level of expertise needed and any topic area that interests you more. And, this would save everyone some time!",
		"lateapp": "It is never too late until the application deadline!  Put in as much effort as possible, follow the application process steps and submit a final proposal on the Google and Outreachy program website by the deadline.\nYou can continue to discuss and improve the application on Phabricator after the deadline. But, be aware that starting so late does put you at a disadvantage. But, the experience of writing and submitting your application will help you prepare for next year, even if you are not accepted. With Outreachy, in some instances (e.g., the project received fewer candidates), mentors can extend the application deadline by a week, but it depends on the mentor to decide on that.",
		"findmentor": "If you would like to propose your own project idea, that is welcome! You could reach out to potential mentors who might have the skills and expertise in the topic area that your project is in. One downside with this approach is that we might not be able to find a suitable mentor for you in time for the application deadline.\nIf you would like to take this approach, you should consider reaching out to us and submitting a proposal early to get timely feedback. If you would like to take this as a challenge, organization administrators would be happy to help you make a connection with experienced developers from our community.",
		"howtoupload": "Follow the 'Application process steps' section for clear instructions on submitting a final proposal for [Google Summer of Code](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/Participants#Application_process_steps) and [Outreachy](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreachy/Participants#Application_process_steps) respectively."
